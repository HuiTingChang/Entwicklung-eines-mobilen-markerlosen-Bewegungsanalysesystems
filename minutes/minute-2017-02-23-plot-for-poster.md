## Activities

### Integrating plot function into the main application

Nuno and Gilbert work on integrating plot functions Gilbert has been
working on into the main application by first enabling showing the
graph of coordinates of the center of gravity over time. Nuno adds
some GUI input elements for this purpose. At the end of the session
we could demonstrate this and take a screenshot for the poster.

### Poster

As the poster is due today, Inna and Yuliia are still working on some
details. Hui-Tingâ€™s formula for joint angle calculation has also been
added. Yushin makes a class diagram. The poster is finished at the end
of the session and we send it to the course instructors.

### Joint angles

Hui-Ting has been working on calculating joint angles and this is now
implemented within `CurrentState`.

### Relative cordination system

Hui-Ting has clarified the exact requirement with our customer (Malte) and is getting her hands on design and implementing it.

## Next session

On the next Monday, the 27th February, a session will not take place
due to Rosenmontag. Hui-Ting will do home office on the following
Tuesday to replace her absence time. The next session will be on
Thursday, the 2nd March.
