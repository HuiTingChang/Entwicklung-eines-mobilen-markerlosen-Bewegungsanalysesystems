## For developers

### Kinect Sensor v2.0 (for XBox One, with Windows adapter)

- Hardware Requirements:
    - USB 3.0, preferably Intel or NEC host controller ([source](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2))
- Required drivers
    - [Kinect for Windows Runtime v2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44559)
      - runs on Windows 8, 8.1, 10 (you might want to consider using Windows to go with the RWTH licene from Microsoft Imagine, but consider the required disk space for Visual Studio!)
    - Runtime v1.5 might run on Windows 7, but USB 3.0 support is incomplete, so not recommended
    - alternative: 
- IDE
    - [Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561)
      - requires Visual Studio 2012 or 2013, currently trying with [2015 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) anyway
        - VS uses 14 GB disk space and installation takes veeeeery long!

## Wii Balance Board

- Required drivers
    - probably best and free and open: [xwiimote](https://dvdhrm.github.io/xwiimote/)
    - for other systems on [wiibrew](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote/Library)
